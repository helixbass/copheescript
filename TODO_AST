- directives
- check makeReturn() more thoroughly eg is ctor.body.makeReturn() desirable when generating AST?
- should test that all expected errors (that would occur when compiling) occur when generating AST
- location data for ClassMethod for static method should include @
- StringLiteral extra.raw escaping - seems like maybe extra.raw should include triple quotes if it's a heredoc and then not escape the quote (in makeDelimitedLiteral())?
- alternate location data includes "else" for inline eg if a then b else c
- (implicit?) object location data should include trailing indented comma? eg
  obj =
    a: 1
    # comment
  same with leading comment eg
  obj =
    ### comment ###
    a: 1
- use ClassProperty for static class fields eg @a: 2?

- should update to OptionalCallExpression/OptionalMemberExpression? Is that where babel 7 landed?
- sourceType
- ESLint plugin to catch grammar rules that wouldn't allow passing along necessary location data? Eg check for rules that return something other than a new object/array and which are then used in a LOC() call (an explicit one or implicitly by being the first/last thing in the production)
- make assertErrorFormat() check AST by default
- chained Ops eg a < b < c
- distinguish Infinity from 2e308
