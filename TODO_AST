- (implicit?) object location data should include trailing indented comment? eg
  obj =
    a: 1
    # comment
  same with leading comment eg
  obj =
    ### comment ###
    a: 1

- StringLiteral extra.raw escaping - seems like maybe extra.raw should include triple quotes if it's a heredoc and then not escape the quote (in makeDelimitedLiteral())?
- TemplateElement.value.cooked?
- StringLiteral escaping (eg "\u2017" un-escapes the unicode escape for value/extra.rawValue)
- ClassProperty variance field?

- add tests for unicode code point escapes etc for interpolated heregex (like there are some for non-interpolated regex/heregex)

- sourceType
- ESLint plugin to catch grammar rules that wouldn't allow passing along necessary location data? Eg check for rules that return something other than a new object/array and which are then used in a LOC() call (an explicit one or implicitly by being the first/last thing in the production)
- literate?

- guide to working on the AST (Github wiki page?)
  - explain that AST nodes need to represent real chunks of source code/have accurate/sequential location data
- automated tests for those assumptions? (https://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript/pull/5247#issuecomment-560044121)
